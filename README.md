# Instagram-Fake-Account-Detection
This beginner-level machine learning project detects whether an Instagram account is genuine, spam, or fake based on features like the number of followers, following, and posts.

Using publicly available Kaggle data, I trained a Logistic Regression classifier to identify account types and visualized the results with clear graphs.

ðŸ”¹ Goal â†’ Build a simple, working classification model

ðŸ”¹ Input â†’ Instagram profile data (follower count, following count, post count)

ðŸ”¹ Output â†’ Predicted account type (genuine, spam, fake) + performance metrics + visualizations

This project helped me practice the end-to-end data science pipeline: loading data, cleaning it, modeling, evaluating, and presenting results.
